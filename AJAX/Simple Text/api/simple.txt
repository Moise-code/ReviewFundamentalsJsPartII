What is Design Thinking?

Design Thinking is an iterative process in which we seek 
to understand the user, challenge assumptions, and redefine
 problems in an attempt to identify alternative strategies 
 and solutions that might not be instantly apparent with our 
 initial level of understanding. At the same time, Design Thinking 
 provides a solution-based approach to solving problems. It is a 
 way of thinking and working as well as a collection of hands-on 
 methods.
